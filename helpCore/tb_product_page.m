%% Face Analysis Toolbox
% This toolbox implements a few feature extraction methods for the failure
% patterns of wafers. We can then use the features for wafer failure
% pattern classification via machine learning algorithms, which are
% available in the Machine Learning toolbox.
%
%% Features
% The Wafer Analysis Toolbox includes tools that can:
%
% * Perform data import from excel files
% * Visualize a single wafer map or a lot of wafer maps
% * Extract features from wafer maps for further automatic classification
% * Examples of using Machine Learning Toolbox for feature selection, feature dimensionality reduction, and classification performance evaluation
